### Hello! Welcome to my GitHub profile! 👋

I'm very new to GitHub so if my page looks unprofessional go figure 🙂

- 📖 About me: I was born in Canada in 2005 and moved to Seattle, Washington in 2021! I love meeting new people and am very open-minded to learn about new things!
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- 🏫 Education: I'm currently studying Computer Science at the University of Washington! I hope to graduate by 2027.
- 🔭 I’m currently refining a Wordle program I made in high school (check it out on my pinned repositories!)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on really anything lol. I have yet to collaborate on a project so it'll be fun to try it out!!
- 🎶 I LOVE classical music! I used to play competitive piano and am now playing trombone in my university's symphonic and marching band!
- 🎮 I play lots of video games: Minecraft, Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes (some1 play with me pls), Roblox, Geometry Dash, SimCity (not too much), and many others!
- 🚗 I like looking at awesome cars. My favorite car brands are Koenigsegg, Pagani, and McLaren.
- 😎 Fun fact: I have a [Geometry Dash video](https://youtu.be/YY6IzhKMrg0?si=r9iVO6UHDtVFGdnE) on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@OfficialBlooms/videos) with over 2 million views!
